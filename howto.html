        <h1>How to use my-computer-details</h1>
        <h3>If you are unsure of how to use the batch files in this repository, here is a short intro which should be able to get you started!</h3>
        <h4>Please note that my-computer-details <u>only</u> works with Windows 10/11</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
        <p>Download the latest version of my-computer-details.zip from this repository and then unzip it in your own computer (does not matter the location)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>There are two different ways that you can run the batch files. The first one is physically going to the file and opening it. If you want to do that, follow the below</p>
        <h4>First, go to the location of the unzipped folder and go to the sub-folder called "batch", then double click on any of the batch files (each batch file links with eachother) and you should be able to run everything inside with no problem!</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>You can also directly run the batch files from the command line. If you want to do it this way, follow the below</p>
        <h4>First navigate to the unzipped folder and open it up in a CLI, then you have to 'cd' into the "batch" sub-folder. After that, if you want to use the mainnet release (again they are all linked together), type out: 'mainmet.bat' and if it does not work, try typing out './mainnet.bat'. If you would like to go to a spesific file, you can just replace the release with the one you want.</h4>
