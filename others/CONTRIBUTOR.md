<h3 align="center">Want to contribute?</h3>

Please note that if you would like to contribute you have to either<br><br>
A: DM via Discord<br>
DM me via `Discord` (my username is `324Hz#4539`) with the exact message below.
<br>⚠️Please change `[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]` to your github username

`[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME] 662895f4-b576-4890-86bf-a83cfc24543cD mergePRauth`

B: PM via Twitter<br>
PM me via <a href="https://twitter.com/win21H2">`Twitter`</a> with the exact message below.
<br>⚠️Please change `[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]` to your github username

`[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME] 059f11ce-3255-4984-954d-2ee9632f9a37T mergePRauth`

This will allow me to see who I can and cannot accept PRs from and this is an important step because if you make a PR without sending me this, I will <u>NOT</u> merge it! Also note that these are the only platforms I work on and if these auth messages are sent on any other platform, I will <u>NOT</u> accept

Thanks,<br>
