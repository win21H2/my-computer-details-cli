<h4 align="center">How to use</h4>
<h5 align="center">The "mainnet" release of the lister is the most stable and I would recommend using it!<br><br>
 - You first have to download this repository as a .zip file.<br>
 - You then have to unzip and you have two options:</h5><br>

<h6 align="center">You can run it via CLI (pt 1)<br>
You can run it via file explorer (pt 2)</h6>

<h3 align="center">pt 1</h3>

- Locate the unzipped folder and open it in CMD (I have only tested it using CMD so Powershell might not work)
<br><br>
- Go to the `batch` folder using the `cd` command
<br><br>
- For the `mainnet` release, type out/copy paste the command `mainnet.bat` and if that does not work, try out `./mainnet.bat`
<br><br>
- For the `beta testnet` release, type out/copy paste the command `beta.bat` and if that does not work, again try out `./beta.bat`
<br><br>
- For the `dev devnet` release, type out/copy paste the command `dev.bat` and if that does not work, again try out `./dev.bat`
<br><br>
- That should bring up a menu which is quite easy to navigate


<h3 align="center">pt 2</h3>

- Locate the unzipped folder and go to the batch directory
<br><br>
- Double click on the release you wish to use: `mainnet` or `beta` or `dev`
<br><br>
- That should again, bring up a menu which is quite easy to navigate
